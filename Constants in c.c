//The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C program. The type of constant can be an integer constant, a floating pointer constant, a string constant, or a character constant. In C language, the const keyword is used to define the constants.

int main(){
  
//  const int num = 100;
//  num = 34;
//  printf("The num is %d" , num);//It will give an error because we cannot modify constant

// const float percentage = 98.7865;
// printf("The percentage is %f" , percentage ); 

//   const char  character = 'a';
//   printf("The character is %c" , character); 

    return 0;
